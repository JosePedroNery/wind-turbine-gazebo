[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmavlink.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "mavlink", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mavlink" with any
  of the following names:

    mavlinkConfig.cmake
    mavlink-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mavlink" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "mavlink_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "mavlink" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
